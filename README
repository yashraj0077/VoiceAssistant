This is my ENGN1931z Final Project.
Contained in this folder is the scripts to actually create the voice assistant.
When running, Main.py takes care of the hot word detection and then passes the
request to the other files depending on what is needed. I decided to spread each
feature into a different file so that the project could be added to easily.
Simply add a new file with the feature and add one line to the onRequest method
in Main.py.

The major features are:
Spotify playback --> spot.py
Retrieve and play rss podcasts --> podcast.py
Get weather (temperature) --> weather.py
Get events and set reminders in iCloud --> icloud.py
Set an alarm clock --> alarm.py


Set up instructions:
    To download Raspotify which is a program to make your pi into a spotify
    connect device run this line in the command line:

    curl -sL https://dtcooper.github.io/raspotify/install.sh | sh

    Aside from installing the python packages needed, you will also have to
    delete the default audio options of the pi to guarantee that everything
    plays out of the usb speakers. This is done by the instructions below, which
    were copied from https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify/issues/40

    sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-blacklist.conf
    add blacklist snd_bcm2835
    save & close
    reboot
    sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
    add options snd-usb-audio index=0
    save & close
    reboot
    You should now see only your USB Audio when you type in aplay -l

    To recreate this directory on your own you will also have to download SnowBoy
    which can be done from the link provided below. In this case that is not needed
    as the folder is already included.

    https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/snowboy/snowboy-releases/rpi-arm-raspbian-8.0-1.1.1.tar.bz2

To run the program go to this directory and type: "python main.py" into the
command line.
